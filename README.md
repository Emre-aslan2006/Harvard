## üîç Description
Task Manager is a browser-based to-do list application that allows users to create, manage, filter, and complete tasks in an intuitive and efficient way. Built entirely using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, it uses the `localStorage` API to preserve user data across browser sessions, ensuring that your tasks stay saved even after closing the tab.

The goal was to build a fully interactive front-end project aligned with CS50x's course content ‚Äî using real-world concepts like DOM manipulation, custom styling, and JavaScript logic ‚Äî without any frameworks or backend dependencies. I wanted to create something polished and functional while keeping the codebase lightweight.

## ‚úÖ Features
- Add tasks with custom priority levels (Low, Medium, High)
- Set optional due dates and start dates
- Search tasks in real-time
- Filter by status: All, Active, Completed
- Toggle between Light and Dark mode
- Track progress visually with a dynamic progress bar
- Edit tasks via double-click and confirmation prompt
- Delete tasks individually
- Custom priority badges with color indicators
- Clean, responsive UI with modern styling

## üß† Technologies Used
- HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (no frameworks)
- CSS variables for theming
- `localStorage` for data persistence
- Responsive styling for mobile and desktop

## üí° Design Decisions
I chose to use plain JavaScript and no external libraries to demonstrate a deep understanding of raw JS concepts as taught in CS50x. Using `localStorage` was a deliberate decision to avoid backend complexity while still supporting persistent data storage.

The UI uses semantic HTML and is fully responsive, designed with mobile-first principles. The progress bar was added to enhance visual clarity and user motivation. Dark mode and theme switching were implemented using CSS variables for maximum flexibility.

## üìö What I Learned
This project pushed me to master interactive DOM manipulation, handle user input reliably, and make a clean, well-structured UI from scratch. I also improved my debugging, problem-solving, and design thinking skills ‚Äî especially in how to structure code for scalability and user experience.
